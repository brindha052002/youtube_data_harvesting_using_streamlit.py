# youtube_data_harvesting_using_streamlit.py

The task is to build a Streamlit app that permits users to analyze data from multiple YouTube channels. Users can input a YouTube channel ID to access data like channel information, video details, and user engagement. The app should facilitate storing the data in a MongoDB database and allow users to collect data from up to 10 different channels. Additionally, it should offer the capability to migrate selected channel data from the data lake to a SQL database for further analysis. The app should enable searching and retrieval of data from the SQL database, including advanced options like joining tables for comprehensive channel information.
